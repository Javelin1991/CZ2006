# CZ2006 : Software Engineering

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt materials that are used in software engineering such as ``UML diagrams``, ``Class diagrams``, ``UseCase Diagrams`` and
various types of diagrams and also learnt about different stages in a software engineering process.

## Coursework Group Project

- Implemented  a native food-based ``Android mobile application`` along with other two team members.  
- Included features such as browsing nearby food restaurants based on different categories such as names, ratings, locations, etc. 
- Implemented other features in the app such as finding nearby carparks and their information 
- Enabled searching both restaurants and carparks by utilizing ``real-time data retrieval`` using google places API and data from https://data.gov.sg/ respectively 
- the storage of the app users information is remote and implemented with ``cloud data storage``.
